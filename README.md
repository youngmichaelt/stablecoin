# stablecoin

#Testing the possibility of creating a stablecoin on Binance Smart Chain

#Update: maybe will test on ETH cause chainlink is bad for BSC currently:(

#Testing:
#1. Test oracle with chainlink on BSC testnet
#2. Test rebase automatically with random times with chainlink
#3. Test rebase with data from swap pools and chainlink
#4. Create algo for rebasing

Order:
1. test rebase by block num
2. get price with chainlink on testnet eth(maybe koven?)
3. add new price to rebase
